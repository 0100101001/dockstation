## Advantages and opportunities

#### Backward Compatibility
The application works with Docker Compose. Use you own or third-party docker-compose.yml configs. DockStation generates a clean and native docker-compose.yml file which can be used even outside the application, using the native Docker Compose CLI commands.

#### Work with services and containers
DockStation helps to manage projects and container settings, e.g. bind a local host to a project, simple version changing, map ports, assign and reassign environment variables, changing entrypoint and start command instructions, configure volumes, quick access to image documentation, quick services containers cleanup and a lot of other useful functionality.

#### Parser (beta)
We have a built-in parser that will help without any problems and deep knowledge of Docker Compose to convert "docker run" command to Docker Compose format and quickly start working with a project and containers.

#### GUI
The application combines many CLI commands into a convenient graphical interface. So that instead of many commands only one click is needed.

#### Observer
With application very convenient to view the status of containers and easily view their logs.

#### Create projects
Creating projects has never been easier. You can create a project in a single click.
