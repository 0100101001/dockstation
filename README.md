## Advantages and opportunities

#### Work with services and containers
The DockStation helps to manage projects and container settings, e.g. bind a local host to a project, simple version changing, map ports, assign and reassign environment variables, change entrypoint and start command instructions, configure volumes, quick access to image documentation, quick services containers cleanup and a lot of other useful functionality.

#### Work with remote Docker containers
The application helps to manage and observe remote containers. We provide many tools, such as as logs monitoring, searching logs, grouping, running tools and getting container info. We also provide amazing authorization tools for remotely connections.

#### Independence
It doesn't require local Docker installation for controlling remote containers. 
It can as well be used as a management and monitoring tool for remote Docker containers. 
Docker Machine support (Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Fusion, Microsoft Hyper-V).

#### Backward Compatibility
The application works with Docker Compose. Use you own or third-party docker-compose.yml configs. DockStation generates a clean and native docker-compose.yml file which can be used even outside the application, using the native Docker Compose CLI commands.

#### Stats monitor
Great and powerful tools for common, multiple and single monitoring of container resources. 
Easy tracking CPU usage, Memory usage, Networks I/O, Blocks I/O.

#### GUI
The application combines many CLI commands into a convenient graphical interface. So that instead of many commands only one click is needed. 

#### Observer
With the application it's very convenient to view the status of containers and easily view their logs

#### Create projects
Creating projects has never been easier. You can create a project in a single click.

#### Parser (beta)
We have a built-in parser that will helps, without any problems and deep knowledge of Docker Compose, convert "docker run" command to Docker Compose format and quickly start working with a project and containers.
